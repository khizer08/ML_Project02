Title:
AI-Powered Weather Forecasting Website Using Linear & Logistic Regression — Modern, Colorful UI/UX — CSV Dataset Provided Internally

Prompt:
“Build a fully functional, responsive, and visually modern Weather Forecasting Website that uses Machine Learning techniques (Linear Regression + Logistic Regression) to predict weather conditions. The UI/UX must be modern, colorful, and visually appealing.

Important:
👉 The ML models must be trained on a CSV dataset that I (the developer) will provide internally.
👉 Users should NOT upload their own CSV files.
👉 All ML processing will be done using the developer’s provided dataset stored on the server.

🎨 UI/UX Requirements

Modern, colorful design (sky blue, gradients, soft shadows)

Clean layout, glassmorphism cards, rounded edges

Smooth transitions and micro-animations

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, desktop

Weather-themed icons and illustrations

Easy navigation bar with colorful icons

📄 Website Pages & Sections
1. Homepage

Hero section showing current weather based on user’s location

Animated background based on weather (sun, rain, clouds, night)

Search bar for entering city

Display key metrics:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

Air pressure

Cloud cover

Buttons for “Forecast”, “ML Predictions”, and “Model Insights”

2. Weather Forecast Page

API-based weather forecast for 5-day or 7-day

Hourly forecasts

Beautiful weather cards

Visual charts:

Temperature trends

Rain probability

Humidity

Optional: weather map integration

3. Machine Learning Models Page

Use the developer-provided CSV dataset (stored in backend) to train:

A. Linear Regression

Predict:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

Show:

Dataset summary

Feature list

Regression line/curve plots

Model performance (RMSE, MSE, R²)

A simple form where user can input values (e.g., humidity, pressure, wind speed) to generate predictions using the trained model

B. Logistic Regression

Classify weather outcomes:

Rain vs No Rain

Cloudy vs Clear

Storm vs Calm

Show:

Dataset overview

Feature correlations

Decision boundary/intuitive visualization

Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall

Form for custom classification predictions

4. Model Insights Page

Explain how the CSV dataset is used

Show dataset statistics and charts (histograms, scatter plots)

Explain how linear + logistic regression work

Display model training pipeline graphic

5. About Page

Describe data sources

Modeling approach

Algorithms used

Technology stack

Developer credits

6. Contact Page

Simple feedback form

Optional: email integration

🧠 Machine Learning Requirements

Dataset comes from a CSV file I provide stored server-side

The builder should implement:

Linear Regression model training

Logistic Regression model training

Model serialization

The models must run predictions real-time in the UI

Show training results:

Loss curves

Regression plots

Confusion matrix

⚙️ Technical Features

Backend can be Python (FastAPI/Flask), Node.js, or serverless

Use OpenWeatherMap or similar API for real-time data

Pre-trained model caching for speed

Structured error handling

Loading animations

SEO optimized pages

🧩 Optional Advanced Features

Dark/Light mode toggle

Weather alerts

Speech-based city search

Animated weather icons (Lottie animations)

📦 Deliverables

Fully designed colorful modern website

Backend with ML models trained on developer-provided CSV

No user-based file upload

Real-time prediction interface

Charts, tables, accuracy metrics

Fully responsive

Clean and modular code

Final instruction to builder:

“Create the entire website using the details above. Ensure that all ML models use the CSV dataset provided internally by the developer, and users should NOT be allowed to upload datasets.”
